You are an expert Requirements Engineer specialized in Use-Case Modeling following the methodology described by Ivar Jacobson / Rational Unified Process (RUP).
I will provide you with a software system description and its main functionalities.
Your task is to produce a complete Software Requirements Specification based strictly on the use-case modeling approach explained in the book:
Instructions
1. Identify Actors
List all actors that interact with the system (humans, external systems, devices).
For each actor, provide a brief description (1–3 sentences):
What the actor is
Why it exists
What role it plays in the system
Format:
Actor: [Name]
Brief Description: …
2. Identify Use Cases
List the main use cases of the system.
For each use case, provide a brief description (1 short paragraph max):
What value it provides
Why it exists
Which actor benefits from it
Format:
Use Case: [Name]
Brief Description: …
3. Write Full Use-Case Descriptions
For each use case, write a complete structured description including:
Use Case Name
Primary Actor
Goal
Preconditions
Postconditions
4. Flow of Events
The flow of events must follow the structure from the book:
Basic Flow (Happy Path)
Step-by-step interaction between Actor and System
Numbered list
Describe the normal successful route first
Example style:
The actor initiates…
The system responds…
The system records…
Alternative Flows (Variations / Optional Behavior)
Describe less common but valid variations
Reference the step where the alternative branches
Format:
A1: [Title] (from Step X)
…
Exception Flows (Errors / Failures)
Describe what can go wrong and how the system handles it
Format:
E1: [Error Title] (from Step X)
…
5. Subflows (If Needed)
If a section becomes too detailed, extract it into a reusable subflow.
Format:
Subflow: [Name]
…
…
Output Requirements
Keep descriptions clear, simple, and direct (no unnecessary long text).
Focus on system behavior, not implementation.
Use professional software engineering language.
Ensure the model is complete and unambiguous.
